\section*{Disclaimer}

These notes originated in a course on the arithmetic of curves taught by David 
Zywina at Cornell. However, a significant amount of material (including, no 
doubt, many errors) has been added since then, so their content is \emph{not} 
an exact reflection of what he covered in class. Moreover, the notation has 
been changed in many places (sometimes significantly) as has the order in which 
material is covered. Any errors in these notes are entirely my fault.
