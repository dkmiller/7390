\section*{Disclaimer}

These notes originated in a course on the arithmetic of curves taught by David 
Zywina at Cornell. However, a significant amount of material (including, no 
doubt, many errors) has been added since then, so they are far from an exact 
reflection of what he covered in class. Moreover, the notation has been changed 
in many places (sometimes significantly) as has the order in which material is 
covered. Most significantly, the tone of these notes differs drastically 
from the perspective David took in class, with the notes being much more 
cohomological and scheme-theoretic than David's more elementary (and 
pedagogically correct) approach. Any errors in these notes are my fault.

\section{Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture}

Consider an elliptic curve $E$ over $\dQ$. It has a model of the form 
$y^2=x^3+a x+b$ with $a,b\in \dZ$ and the discriminant 
$\Delta=-16(4 a^3+27 b^2)\ne 0$. The Mordell-Weil theorem (proved in this case 
by Mordell) tells us that $E(\dQ)$ is finitely generated. By basic algebra, 
we can write $E(\dQ) = E(\dQ)_\text{tors}\oplus \dZ^r$ where 
$E(\dQ)_\text{tors}$ is finite, and $r=\rank E(\dQ)$ is the algebraic rank of 
$E$ (over $\dQ$). The group $E(\dQ)_\text{tors}$ can be computed. One way is to 
look at the map $E(\dQ)_\text{tors}\to E(\dF_p)\times E(\dF_{p'})$, which is 
injective when $p$ and $p'$ are distinct primes of good reduction. For 
example, we could choose $p\ne p'$, with both not dividing $\Delta$. 

The group $E(\dQ)$ is one of a finite list. In fact, there is the following 
deep theorem of Mazur (conjectured by Ogg).

\begin{theorem}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\dQ$. Then $E(\dQ)_\textnormal{tors}$ is 
isomorphic to one of the following:
\begin{align*}
  \dZ/n & \text{ with $1\leqslant n\leqslant 12$ and $n\ne 11$} \\
  \dZ/2\oplus \dZ/2 n & \text{ with $1\leqslant n\leqslant 4$}
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
(Cite Mazur's paper\ldots mention his techniques.) 
Each of these possibilities occur infinitely often.

Unlike the situation with $E(\dQ)_\text{tors}$, where everything is computable 
and well-understood, there is no known algorithm to compute the rank of an 
elliptic curve. If $\sha(E)$ is finite, then there is an algorithm, but the 
finiteness of $\sha(E)$ is not known in general. 

The vague idea of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (henceforth BSD) is 
as follows. Suppose $E(\dQ)$ has high rank. Then for $p$ a prime of good 
reduction, we have a map $E(\dQ) \to E(\dF_p)$. (Scheme-theoretically, 
$E(\dF_p)$ doesn't make sense. We set $E(\dF_p) = \cE(\dF_p)$, where 
$\cE$ is the N\'eron model of $E$ over $\dF[\frac 1 p]$. Since 
$E(\dQ) = E(\dZ)$, we are really looking at the map 
$E(\dZ) \to \cE(\dF_p)$.) The group $E(\dF_p)$ has order 
$p+1-a_p(E)$, where $a_p(E) = a(\cE_{\dF_p})$, and 
$|a_p(E)|\leqslant 2\sqrt p$. The expectation is for $E(\dF_p)$ to be 
``slightly larger'' than average, given that the map 
$E(\dQ) \to E(\dF_p)$ gives us some points ``for free.'' This effect turns out 
to be very subtle. 

Define the function $\pi_E$ on $\dR_{\geqslant 0}$ by 
\[
  \pi_E(x) = \prod_{p\leqslant x \text{ good}} \frac{\# E(\dF_p)}{p} \text{.}
\]
We hope that $r=\rank E$ can be detected from the growth of $\pi_E$. In the 
early 60s, Swinnerton-Dyer used a computer to get numerical data on these 
types of problem. He and Birch conjectured the following: 
\[
  \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\log \pi_E(x)}{\log \log x} = r
\]
One could also conjecture that $\pi_E(X) \sim C (\log x)^r$ as $x\to \infty$ 
for some constant $C$. The function $\pi_E$ is hard to work with. Instead, we 
will follow standard practice in number theory and introduce an $L$-function. 

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\dQ$ with discriminant $\Delta$. The 
\emph{partial $L$-function of $E$} is 
\[
  L_\Delta(E,s) = \prod_{p\nmid \Delta} \frac{1}{1-a_p(E) p^{-s} + p^{1-2s}} \text{.}
\]
\end{definition}

Here, $s$ is a complex variable, but this product does converge on the whole 
complex plane. Recall that if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\dF_p$, the 
characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius $\Phi_E$ acting on $T_\ell E$ is 
$t^2-a_p t + p$. The reverse of this is 
$\det(1-\Phi^\ast t,V_\ell E) = 1-a_p t + p t^2$. (\textbf{finish, clarify 
relationship to \'etale cohomology\ldots $L$-functions for arbitrary schemes 
of finite type over $\spec(\dZ)$\ldots})

\begin{lemma}
The product defining $L_\Delta(E,s)$ converges absolutely for all $s\in \dC$ 
with $\Re s>\frac 3 2$. Moreover, $L_\Delta(E,s)$ is holomorphic on that 
region. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The basic idea is to use the factorization 
$1-a_p t + p t^2 = (2-\omega_{p,1} t)(1-\omega_{p,2})$, with 
$|\omega_{p,i}| = p^{1/2}$ by the Weil conjectures. We can write  
\[
  L_\Delta(E,s) = \prod_{p\nmid \Delta} \left(1-\frac{\omega_{p,1}}{p^{1/2}} p^{1/2-s}\right)^{-1}\left( 1-\frac{\omega_{p,2}}{p^{1/2}} p^{1/2-s}\right)^{-1}
\]
Standard arguments (using only the fact that the $\omega_{p,i}$ are $p$-Weil) 
yield the result. 
\end{proof}

Following Euler, we look at $L_\Delta(E,1)$, (which does not exist unless 
$L_\Delta(E,s)$ has some kind of analytic continuation, which we have not 
proved). At least formally (ignoring convergence) we have 
\begin{align*}
  L_\Delta(E,1) &= \prod_{p\nmid \Delta} (1-a_p(E) p^{-1} + p^{-1})^{-1} \\
    &= \prod_{p\nmid \Delta} \frac{p}{p-a_p(E)+1} \\
    &= \prod_{p\nmid \Delta} \frac{p}{\# E(\dF_p)}
\end{align*}
This looks very similar to our definition of the function $\pi_E$. At least 
intuitively, larger $r$ should lead to ``quicker vanishing'' at $s=1$. 

\begin{conjecture}[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer]
The function $L_\Delta(E,s)$ has an analytic continuation to a neighborhood of 
$s=1$. Moreover, 
\[
  \ord_{s=1} L_\Delta(E,s) = \rank E \text{.}
\]
\end{conjecture}

In other words, the conjecture says that $L_\Delta(E,s)\sim c(s-1)^r$ near 
$s=1$ for some constant $c$. Modern formulations of BSD include a formula for 
$c$. 

Let's define the factors in $L(E,s)$ for primes $p\mid \Delta$. For such a 
prime, $E$ will have a N\'eron model $\cE_p$ over $\dZ_{(p)}$, and the 
reduction $(\cE_p)_{\dF_p}$ will either be smooth (good reduction), have a 
cusp (additive reduction), or a double point (multiplicative reduction). In the 
latter two cases, the nonsingular locus of $(\cE_p)_{\dF_p}$ is isomorphic (as 
a group scheme) to $\dG_{a,\dF_p}$ and $\dG_{m,\dF_p}$ respectively. 
We put the local factor to be 
\[
  L_p(E,s) = \begin{cases}
               \frac{1}{1-a_p p^{-s} + p^{1-2 s}} & \text{if $p$ has good reduction} \\
               1 & \text{if $p$ has additive reduction} \\
               \frac{1}{1-a_p p^{-s}} & \text{if $p$ has multiplicative reduction}
             \end{cases}
\]
If $E$ has multiplicative reduction at $p$, we set $a_p=1$ if the singularity 
is defined over $\dF_p$, and $a_p=-1$ otherwise. 

More abstractly, the reduction $E_{\dF_p} = (\cE_p)_{\dF_p}$ will be a group 
scheme over $\dF_p$, with nonsingular locus $E_{p,\text{ns}}$ (also a group 
scheme). Generally, 
\[
  L_p(E,1) = \frac{p}{\# E_{p,\text{ns}}(E_p)}
\]

The global $L$-function of $E$ is 
\[
  L(E,s) = \prod_p L_p(E,s) \text{.}
\]
