\newpage
\section*{Disclaimer}

These notes originated in a course on the arithmetic of curves taught by David 
Zywina at Cornell. However, a significant amount of material (including, no 
doubt, many errors) has been added since then, so they are far from an exact 
reflection of what he covered in class. Moreover, the notation has been changed 
in many places (sometimes significantly) as has the order in which material is 
covered. Most significantly, the tone of these notes differs drastically 
from the perspective David took in class, with the notes being much more 
cohomological and scheme-theoretic than David's more elementary (and 
pedagogically correct) approach. Any errors in these notes are my fault.
