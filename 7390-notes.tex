\section{Plane curves}

Fir a non-constant polynomial $f(x,y)\in\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Assume $f$ is 
geometrically irreducible (i.e. irreducible in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}[x,y]$). 
We can define the curve $C$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ determined by the equation 
$f(x,y)=0$. For now, we will think of $C$ in terms of its functor of points. 
To any $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $A$, we have $C(A)=\{(a,b)\in A^2:f(a,b)=0\}$. 
For those of you who know about schemes, 
$C=\spec\left(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f\right)$. Some big questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is $C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$?
  \item Is $C(\mathbb{Q})$ finite?
  \item Can we compute $C(\mathbb{Q})$?
\end{enumerate}
None of these questions are known in full generality. 

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^2+y^2-1$, i.e. $C$ is the circle. It is well-known that 
\[
  C(\mathbb{Q})=\left\{\left(\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\right):t\in\mathbb{Q}\right\}\cup \{(-1,0)\}
\]
This can be proved in the usual manner by choosing the point 
$(-1,0)$ in $C$, and then drawing lines with rational slopes through 
$(-1,0)$. As a Riemann surface, $C(\mathbb{C})$ is a sphere minus 
two points. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^2+y^2+1$. Then $C(\mathbb{R})=\varnothing$, hence 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$. But as a Riemann surface, $C(\mathbb{C})$ is 
once again a sphere minus two points. Thus the geometry of $C$ does not 
necessarily determine $C(\mathbb{Q})$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^4+y^4-1$. Then it is a theorem of Fermat that 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\{(\pm 1,0),(0,\pm 1)\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Stoll]
Consider 
\begin{align*}
  C : y^2 = 82342800 x^6 &- 470135160 x^5 + 52485681 x^4 + 2396040466 x^3 \\
    &+ 567207969 x^2 - 985905640 x + 247747600
\end{align*}
This is a curve of genus 2, i.e. $C(\mathbb{C})$ is a punctured two-hole 
torus. It turns out that $\# C(\mathbb{Q})\geqslant 642$ \cite[\S 6]{st09}. 
However, by a theorem of Faltins, $\# C(\mathbb{Q})$ is finite. It is 
currently the largest known number of rational points of a genus two curve 
over $\mathbb{Q}$. If we take $C:y^2=f(x)$ with $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ a 
``random'' sextic polynomial, then the expectation is that 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$. 
\end{example}

\begin{question}
Does there exist a number $B_g$ such that if a curve $C/\mathbb{Q}$ has 
genus $g\geqslant 2$, then $\# C(\mathbb{Q})\leqslant B_g$?
\end{question}

This is not even known for genus $g=2$. See for example \href{http://mathoverflow.net/questions/103327/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-rational-points-of-a-curve-of-genus-2-over-the-rat}{this mathoverflow answer}. 

\begin{example}
Let $C:y^2=x^3+875 x$. Note that $C(\mathbb{Q})$ has the obvious point 
$(0,0)$, and one can do a bit of work to show that this is the only point. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $C:y^2=x^3+877 x$. Then $C(\mathbb{Q})$ once again contains $(0,0)$. A 
computer search showed that $(0,0)$ is the only point on $C$ of height 
$\leqslant 1000000$. For now, the \emph{height} of a solution is just the 
largest absolute value of the numerator / denominator of a solution written 
in reduced fractions. But there should be more solutions! Let $E$ be the 
projective curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ obtained by adjoining a point $O$ to $C$. 
As a Riemann surface, $E(\mathbb{C})$ is just a torus. 

We can give $E/\mathbb{Q}$ the structure of an abelian variety. That is, 
we can give $E$ the structure of a commutative algebraic group, i.e. the 
operation is given by rational functions, with $O$ being the identity. 

Later, we will think of $E\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Jac}(E)$, where 
$\operatorname{Jac}(E)$ is the Jacobian of $E$. This embedding is determined 
by a single point $O\in E$. 

In particular, $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is an abelian group with identity $O$. It is 
a theorem of Mordell that $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is in fact finitely generated. We 
know the structure of such groups: $A\simeq A\times \mathbb{Z}^r$, where 
$A$ is finite, and $r=\operatorname{rk} E$ is the \emph{rank} of $E$. 

In general, $A$ is computable. In our case, $A=\mathbb{Z}/2$. The hard 
computational problem is: ``what is $r$''? The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer 
conjecture says that $r$ agrees with the order of vanishing $r'$ of a certain 
holomorphic function $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$. Fortunately, $r'$ is (usually) 
computable. In our example, a computation shows that $r'=1$, so we expect 
$E(\mathbb{Q})\simeq \mathbb{Z}/2\times\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, 
$E(\mathbb{Q})$ should be infinite. One can show (using other methods) that 
$E(\mathbb{Q})=\langle (0,0),(x_0,y_0)\rangle$, where 
\[
  x_0 = \frac{37 5494 5281 2716 2193 1055 0406 9942 0927 9234 6201}{6215 9877 7687 1505 4254 6322 0780 6972 3804 4100}
\]
For details, see \cite{br84} -- they use Heegner points. Though his proof wasn't 
accepted at the time, Heegner solved the class number one problem, i.e. 
determined which imaginary quadratic fields have class number one. 
\end{example}

In general, we will take a curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, consider its jacobian $J$, 
and look at $J(\mathbb{Q})$. This will be a group, and we will see how its 
structure influences $E(\mathbb{Q})$. The ``average rank of an elliptic 
curve'' is not known, nor is there a general consensus on what is should be. 
Some expect it the rank of a random curve to be $0$ or $1$, both with 
probability $\frac 1 2$. Others claim that elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ 
have rank $2$ with nonzero probability as well. It was proven recently (see 
\cite[\S 1]{bh10}) that 
\[
  \limsup_{B\to\infty} \frac{1}{4 B^2} \sum_{|a|,|b|\leqslant B} \operatorname{rk}(E_{a,b}) \leqslant 1.5
\]
where $E_{a,b}$ is the elliptic curve defined by $y^2=x^3 +a x+b$.

\begin{question}
Is $\operatorname{rk} E(\mathbb{Q})$ bounded for all elliptic curves 
$E/\mathbb{Q}$?
\end{question}

The current record is 19. It is known that there are curves with rank at least 
$28$, but their exact ranks are not known \cite{du}. It is generally thought 
that the answer is no, and that the NSA has examples of curves with much 
larger ranks than publicly known. 

In general, the assumption that $f(x,y)$ is absolutely irreducible is not a 
serious one. For example, if $f=y^2-x^2$, then we can factor $f$ as 
$(x+y)(x-y)$, and then treat the solutions to $x+y=0$ and $x-y=0$ separately. 
Another example is $f=x^2+y^2$, which only factors over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ as 
$(y+i x)(y-i x)$, and we can treat these components separately. Also, the 
assumption that $f\in \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ is not serious. One can prove that 
every curve $C/\mathbb{Q}$ embeds into $\mathbb{P}^2_\mathbb{Q}$, hence is 
birational to a plane curve. 

Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be a curve. Then 
$C(\mathbb{C})\setminus \{\text{singular points}\}$ is a compact Riemann 
surface with points remove, i.e. it is a torus with $g$ handles with finitely 
many points removed. Call this $g$ the \emph{genus} of $C$. 

\begin{theorem}[Faltings, conjectured by Mordell]
If $C$ is a curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $g\geqslant 2$, then $C(\mathbb{Q})$ 
is finite. 
\end{theorem}

For curves of genus $1$, very little is known in general. In Faltings' 
theorem, $\mathbb{Q}$ can be replace by any field finitely generated over 
$\mathbb{Q}$. 

Now let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. 
We are interested in $|C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})|$, which is obviously computable 
for each $n$. Let 
\[
  Z(C,t) = \exp\left( \sum_{n>0} \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \frac{t^n}{n} \right) \in \mathbb{Q}\llbracket t\rrbracket 
\]

\begin{theorem}[Weil]
If $C/\mathbb{F}_p$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, then 
\[
  Z(C,t) = \frac{P(C,t)}{(1-t)(1-p t)}
\]
where $P(C,t)\in \mathbb{Z}[t]$ has degree $2 g$. Moreover, if 
$P(C,t) = \prod_{i=1}^{2 g} (1-\alpha_i t)$, then for each $i$, one has 
$|\alpha_i|=p^{1/2}$. 
\end{theorem}

The second statement in the theorem is called the \emph{Riemann hypothesis} 
for $C$. It can be used to obtain explicit bounds on the size of 
$C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$ as $n\to\infty$. For example, we can compute 
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{n>0} \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \frac{t^n}{n} 
    &= \log Z(C,t) \\
    &= -\log(1-t) - \log(1-p t) + \sum_i \log(1-\alpha_t t) \\
    &= \sum_{n>0} \left(p^n+1-\sum_{i=1}^{2 g} \alpha_i^n\right) \frac{t^n}{n}
\end{align*}
It follows easily that 
$|\# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})-(p^n+1)| \leqslant 2 g p^{n/2}$. This is equivalent 
to saying 
\[
  p^n-2 g p^{n/2}+1 \leqslant \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \leqslant p^n + 2 g p^{n/2} + 1
\]
In particular, setting $n = g = 1$, we obtain 
$\# C(\mathbb{F}_p) \geqslant (p^{1/2}-1)^2>0$, i.e. 
$C(\mathbb{F}_p)\ne\varnothing$.

\section{Some geometry: jacobians over $\mathbb{C}$}

For now, we'll work a lot over $\mathbb{C}$. First, some definitions:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{variety} over a field $k$ is a separated scheme of finite type over 
$\spec(k)$. We call a variety $X/k$ \emph{nice} if it is smooth, projective, 
and geometrically integral.
\end{definition}

Recall that $X/k$ is \emph{geometrically integral} if 
$X_{\bar k}=X\times_k \spec(\bar k)$ is dimension $1$. A \emph{curve} is a 
variety of dimension one. If we are interested in $C(k)$ for general curves, 
it is sufficient to consider nice curves. If $V$ is a variety, we can consider 
its functor of points $h_V:\mathsf{Alg}_k\to \mathsf{Set}$ which assigns to a 
$k$-algebra $A$ the set $V(A)$ of ``$A$-valued points.'' We can also consider 
$h_V:\mathsf{Sch}_k^\circ\to\mathsf{Set}$ which is defined by 
$h_V(X)=\hom_k(X,V)$. 

Earlier, for $f\in \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ a nonconstant polynomial and $A$ a 
$\mathbb{Q}$-algebra, if $C:f=0$, we have 
\begin{align*}
  C(A) &= \{(a,b)\in A^2:f(a,b) = 0\} \\
    &= \hom_{\mathsf{Alg}_\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f,A) \\
    &= \hom_{\mathsf{Sch}_k}\left(\spec A,\spec(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f)\right) \\
    &= C(\spec A)
\end{align*}

\begin{remark}
The functor $h_V$ determines $V$, up to isomorphism. (This is just the Yoneda 
lemma).
\end{remark}

For the rest of this section, let $C$ be a nice curve over $\mathbb{C}$. Set 
$X=C(\mathbb{C})$; this is a smooth compact, connected, irreducible Riemann 
surface. So topologically, $X$ is a many-handled torus. Let 
$\Lambda=\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$, the first homology group of $X$, which can be 
identified with $\pi_1(X)^\text{ab}$. So elements of $\Lambda$ are 
equivalence classes $[\gamma]$ for $\gamma\in \pi_1(X)$. 

\begin{remark}
The notation $\h_\bullet$, $\pi_1$\ldots will always denote the 
\emph{topological} homology, fundamental group\ldots. Etale cohomology 
will be given the subscript $(-)_\text{et}$, e.g. $\h_\text{et}^\bullet(C)$.
\end{remark}

It is a theorem of algebraic topology that $\Lambda\simeq\mathbb{Z}^{2 g}$; we 
will call $g$ the \emph{genus} of $X$ (and also of $C$). Let $K$ be the field 
of meromorphic functions on $X$. 

\begin{remark}
We can identify $K$ with the function field of $C$. \textbf{details!}

Moreover, $C$ can be recovered from $X$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{question}
Does the homology group $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$ have an algebraic definition?
\end{question}

Essentially, the answer is no. If we want to define $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$ 
algebraically, then the answer is a resounding yes!

With $C$ as before, let $V=\Omega^1(X)=\h^0(X,\Omega^1)=\h^1_\text{dR}(X)$. 
This is a complex vector space of dimension $g$. (Here, we mean analytic de 
Rham cohomology -- the algebraic de Rham cohomology would be denoted 
$\h_\text{dR}^1(C/\mathbb{C})$.) This gives us an algebraic definition of $g$. 
We can consider $\Omega^1$ as the sheaf of (algebraic) differentials, and 
$g=\dim_\mathbb{C}\h^0(X,\Omega^1)$. There is a pairing 
$\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})\otimes\h_\text{dR}^1(X)\to\mathbb{C}$, defined by 
\[
  [\gamma]\otimes \omega \mapsto \int_\gamma \omega
\]
This pairing is $\mathbb{C}$-linear in the second component, and is in fact 
non-degenerate. It gives us a map $\Phi:\Lambda\to V^*$. 

\begin{definition}[analytic]
The \emph{Jacobian} of $X$ is 
$\jac X=V^*/\Phi(X) = \h_\textnormal{dR}^1(X)^*/\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. 
\end{definition}

Is is known that $\Phi(\Lambda)$ is a lattice in $V^*$, i.e. it is discrete 
and $V^*/\Phi(\Lambda)$ is compact. There is the \emph{Abel-Jacobi map} from 
$X$ to $\jac X$ defined as follows. Fix $x_0\in X$; we send $x\in X$ to 
$\omega\mapsto \int_{[x_0,x]} \omega$, where $[x_0,x]$ denotes some path from 
$x_0$ to $x$. A different choice of $[x_0,x]$ will differ by a closed loop, 
i.e. an element of $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z}$. So $X\to\jac X$ is well-defined. Note 
that $\jac X$ is a complex Lie group. 

\begin{remark}
After choosing a basis for $V^*$, we have $\jac X\simeq \mathbb{C}^g/L$, where 
$L\simeq \mathbb{Z}^{2 g}$. As a real Lie group, $\jac X$ is diffeomorphic to 
$(S^1)^{2 g}$. 
\end{remark}

We care about $\jac X$ because, despite its analytic definition, it is in fact 
a projective variety.

\begin{theorem}
For $X$ a compact Riemann surface, $\jac X$ is algebraic, i.e. there exists a 
variety $J$ defined over $\mathbb{C}$ such that $J(\mathbb{C})\simeq\jac X$ as 
complex manifolds. Moreover, the group operation on $\jac X$ is algebraic, 
i.e. there is a morphism $m:J\times_\mathbb{C} J\to J$ such that 
$J(\mathbb{C})\times J(\mathbb{C})\to J(\mathbb{C})$ corresponds to the 
addition law on $\jac X$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
look up in \cite{mu08}
\end{proof}

Let $\Div X$ be the free abelian group generated by the points of $X$. There 
is a map $\deg:\Div X\to \mathbb{Z}$, defined by 
$\sum n_P\cdot P\mapsto \sum n_P$. We define $\Div^\circ X$ by the short exact 
sequence 
\[
  0 \to \Div^\circ X \to \Div X \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
\]
There is also a map $\operatorname{div}:K^\times\to \Div X$, where 
$\operatorname{div}(f) = \sum_P \ord_P(f)\cdot P$. It is a basic fact that 
$\deg(\operatorname{div}(f)) = 0$, so we can define the \emph{Picard group} 
of $X$ to be $\pic X = \Div X/\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$ and 
$\pic^\circ X = \Div^\circ (X)/\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$. 

\begin{remark}
Let $\mathscr{M}$ be the sheaf of meromorphic functions on $X$. One can 
prove that $\Div(X)=\h^0(X,\mathscr{M}^\times/\mathscr{O}^\times)$ and 
$\pic(X)=\h^1(X,\mathscr{O}^\times)$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
One can prove that $\pic^\circ(\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})) = 0$.
\end{example}

The Abel-Jacobi map $\mu:X\to \jac X$ extends to a map 
$\mu:\Div^\circ X\to \jac X$. 

\begin{theorem}[Jacobi]
The map $\mu:\Div^\circ X\to\jac X$ is surjective.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Abel]
The kernel of $\mu:\Div^\circ X\to \jac X$ is $\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$. 
\end{theorem}

It follows that $\mu$ induces an isomorphism $\mu:\pic^\circ X\to \jac X$. 
Note that $\pic^\circ X$ parameterizes invertible sheaves (line bundles) on 
$X$ of degree zero. 

Note that in general, $\mathbb{C}^g/L$ for some lattice $L$ need not be 
algebraic if $g>1$. In the future, we'll try to define $\jac C$ for a curve 
$C$ over an any field. The variety $\jac C$ will be a nice variety, i.e. 
smooth, projective and geometrically integral. We will use this to give an 
algebraic definition of $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$.
