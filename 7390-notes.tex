\section{Plane curves}

Fir a non-constant polynomial $f(x,y)\in\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Assume $f$ is 
geometrically irreducible (i.e. irreducible in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}[x,y]$). 
We can define the curve $C$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ determined by the equation 
$f(x,y)=0$. For now, we will think of $C$ in terms of its functor of points. 
To any $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $A$, we have $C(A)=\{(a,b)\in A^2:f(a,b)=0\}$. 
For those of you who know about schemes, 
$C=\spec\left(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f\right)$. Some big questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is $C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$?
  \item Is $C(\mathbb{Q})$ finite?
  \item Can we compute $C(\mathbb{Q})$?
\end{enumerate}
None of these questions are known in full generality. 

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^2+y^2-1$, i.e. $C$ is the circle. It is well-known that 
\[
  C(\mathbb{Q})=\left\{\left(\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\right):t\in\mathbb{Q}\right\}\cup \{(-1,0)\}
\]
This can be proved in the usual manner by choosing the point 
$(-1,0)$ in $C$, and then drawing lines with rational slopes through 
$(-1,0)$. As a Riemann surface, $C(\mathbb{C})$ is a sphere minus 
two points. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^2+y^2+1$. Then $C(\mathbb{R})=\varnothing$, hence 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$. But as a Riemann surface, $C(\mathbb{C})$ is 
the same sphere minus two points. Thus the geometry of $C$ does not 
necessarily determine $C(\mathbb{Q})$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $f=x^4+y^4-1$. Then it is a theorem of Fermat that 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\{(\pm 1,0),(0,\pm 1)\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Stoll]
Consider 
\begin{align*}
  C : y^2 = 82342800 x^6 &- 470135160 x^5 + 52485681 x^4 + 2396040466 x^3 \\
    &+ 567207969 x^2 - 985905640 x + 247747600
\end{align*}
This is a curve of genus 2, i.e. $C(\mathbb{C})$ is a punctured two-hole 
torus. It turns out that $\# C(\mathbb{Q})\geqslant 642$ \cite[\S 6]{st09}. 
However, by a theorem of Faltings, $\# C(\mathbb{Q})$ is finite. It is 
currently the largest known number of rational points of a genus two curve 
over $\mathbb{Q}$. If we take $C:y^2=f(x)$ with $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ a 
``random'' sextic polynomial, then the expectation is that 
$C(\mathbb{Q})=\varnothing$. 
\end{example}

\begin{question}
Does there exist a number $B_g$ such that if a curve $C/\mathbb{Q}$ has 
genus $g\geqslant 2$, then $\# C(\mathbb{Q})\leqslant B_g$?
\end{question}

This is not even known for genus $g=2$. 

\begin{example}
Let $C:y^2=x^3+875 x$. Note that $C(\mathbb{Q})$ has the obvious point 
$(0,0)$, and one can do a bit of work to show that this is the only point. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $C:y^2=x^3+877 x$. Then $C(\mathbb{Q})$ once again contains $(0,0)$. A 
computer search showed that $(0,0)$ is the only point on $C$ of height 
$\leqslant 1000000$. For now, the \emph{height} of a solution is just the 
largest absolute value of the numerator / denominator of a solution written 
in reduced fractions. But there should be more solutions! Let $E$ be the 
projective curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ obtained by adjoining a point $O$ to $C$. 
As a Riemann surface, $E(\mathbb{C})$ is just a torus. 

We can give $E/\mathbb{Q}$ the structure of an abelian variety. That is, 
we can give $E$ the structure of a commutative algebraic group, i.e. the 
operation is given by rational functions, with $O$ being the identity. 

Later, we will think of $E\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Jac}(E)$, where 
$\operatorname{Jac}(E)$ is the Jacobian of $E$. This embedding is determined 
by a single point $O\in E$. 

In particular, $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is an abelian group with identity $O$. It is 
a theorem of Mordell that $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is in fact finitely generated. We 
know the structure of such groups: $E(\mathbb{Q})\simeq A\times \mathbb{Z}^r$, 
where $A$ is finite, and $r=\operatorname{rk} E$ is the \emph{rank} of $E$. 

In general, $A$ is computable. In our case, $A=\mathbb{Z}/2$. The hard 
computational problem is: ``what is $r$''? The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer 
conjecture says that $r$ agrees with the order of vanishing $r'$ of a certain 
holomorphic function $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$. Sometimes, $r'$ can be computed.  
In our example, a computation shows that $r'=1$, so we expect 
$E(\mathbb{Q})\simeq \mathbb{Z}/2\times\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, 
$E(\mathbb{Q})$ should be infinite. One can show (using other methods) that 
$E(\mathbb{Q})=\langle (0,0),(x_0,y_0)\rangle$, where 
\[
  x_0 = \frac{37 5494 5281 2716 2193 1055 0406 9942 0927 9234 6201}{6215 9877 7687 1505 4254 6322 0780 6972 3804 4100}
\]
For details, see \cite{br84}. One method to construct such large solutions for 
a rank one elliptic curve uses Heegner points. 
\end{example}

In general, we will take a curve $C/\mathbb{Q}$, consider its jacobian $J$, 
and study $J(\mathbb{Q})$. This will be a group, and its structure heavily 
influences $C(\mathbb{Q})$. The ``average rank of an elliptic curve'' is not 
known, nor is there a general consensus on what is should be. Some expect it 
the rank of a random curve to be $0$ or $1$, both with probability 
$\frac 1 2$. Others suppose that elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ have rank 
$2$ with nonzero probability as well. It was proven recently (see 
\cite[\S 1]{bh10}) that 
\[
  \limsup_{B\to\infty} \frac{1}{4 B^2} \sum_{\substack{|a|,|b|\leqslant B \\ 4 a^3+27 b^2\ne 0}} \operatorname{rk}(E_{a,b}) \leqslant\frac 7 6
\]
where $E_{a,b}$ is the elliptic curve defined by $y^2=x^3 +a x+b$.

\begin{question}
Is $\operatorname{rk} E(\mathbb{Q})$ bounded for all elliptic curves 
$E/\mathbb{Q}$?
\end{question}

It is known that there are curves with rank at least $28$, but their exact 
ranks are not known \cite{du}. The largest known rank is $19$. 
%It is generally thought that the answer is no, and that the NSA has examples of curves with 
%much larger ranks than publicly known. 

In general, the assumption that $f(x,y)$ is absolutely irreducible is not a 
serious one. For example, if $f=y^2-x^2$, then we can factor $f$ as 
$(x+y)(x-y)$, and then treat the solutions to $x+y=0$ and $x-y=0$ separately. 
Another example is $f=x^2+y^2$, which only factors over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ as 
$(y+i x)(y-i x)$, and we the rational points lie in the intersection of the 
two components over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Also, the assumption that 
$f\in \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ is not serious. One can prove that every curve 
$C/\mathbb{Q}$ embeds into $\mathbb{P}^2_\mathbb{Q}$, hence is birational to 
a plane curve. 

Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be a curve. Then 
$C(\mathbb{C})\setminus \{\text{singular points}\}$ is a compact Riemann 
surface with points removed, i.e. it is a torus with $g$ handles with finitely 
many points removed. Call this $g$ the \emph{genus} of $C$. 

\begin{theorem}[Faltings, conjectured by Mordell]
If $C$ is a curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $g\geqslant 2$, then $C(\mathbb{Q})$ 
is finite. 
\end{theorem}

For curves of genus $g<2$, $\# C(\mathbb{Q})$ can be infinite. In Faltings' 
theorem, $\mathbb{Q}$ can be replace by any field finitely generated over 
$\mathbb{Q}$. 

Now let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. 
We are interested in $|C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})|$, which is obviously computable 
for each $n$. Let 
\[
  Z(C,t) = \exp\left( \sum_{n>0} \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \frac{t^n}{n} \right) \in \mathbb{Q}\llbracket t\rrbracket 
\]

\begin{theorem}[Weil]
If $C/\mathbb{F}_p$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, then 
\[
  Z(C,t) = \frac{P(C,t)}{(1-t)(1-p t)}
\]
where $P(C,t)\in \mathbb{Z}[t]$ has degree $2 g$. Moreover, if 
$P(C,t) = \prod_{i=1}^{2 g} (1-\alpha_i t)$, then for each $i$, one has 
$|\alpha_i|=p^{1/2}$. 
\end{theorem}

The second statement in the theorem is called the \emph{Riemann hypothesis} 
for $C$. It can be used to obtain explicit bounds on the size of 
$C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$ as $n\to\infty$. For example, we can compute 
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{n>0} \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \frac{t^n}{n} 
    &= \log Z(C,t) \\
    &= -\log(1-t) - \log(1-p t) + \sum_i \log(1-\alpha_t t) \\
    &= \sum_{n>0} \left(p^n+1-\sum_{i=1}^{2 g} \alpha_i^n\right) \frac{t^n}{n} \text{.}
\end{align*}
Therefore, $\# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) = p^n+1-\sum_{i=1}^{2 g} \alpha_i^n$. It 
follows easily that $|\# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})-(p^n+1)| \leqslant 2 g p^{n/2}$. 
This is equivalent to saying 
\[
  p^n-2 g p^{n/2}+1 \leqslant \# C(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) \leqslant p^n + 2 g p^{n/2} + 1
\]
In particular, setting $n = g = 1$, we obtain 
$\# C(\mathbb{F}_p) \geqslant (p^{1/2}-1)^2>0$, hence 
$C(\mathbb{F}_p)\ne\varnothing$.

\section{Some analysis: jacobians over \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{C}$}{C}}

In this section, we will mostly work over $\mathbb{C}$ and treat curves as 
Riemann surfaces. First, some more general definitions:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{variety} over a field $k$ is a separated scheme of finite type over 
$\spec(k)$. We call a variety $X/k$ \emph{nice} if it is smooth, projective, 
and geometrically integral.
\end{definition}

Recall that $X/k$ is \emph{geometrically integral} if 
$X_{\bar k}=X\times_k \spec(\bar k)$ is dimension $1$. A \emph{curve} is a 
variety of dimension one. If we are interested in $C(k)$ for general curves, 
it is sufficient to consider nice curves. If $X$ is a variety, we can consider 
its functor of points $h_X:\mathsf{Alg}_k\to \mathsf{Set}$ which assigns to a 
$k$-algebra $A$ the set $X(A)$ of ``$A$-valued points.'' This determines a 
functor $h_X:\mathsf{Sch}_k^\circ\to\mathsf{Set}$ which is defined by 
$h_X(Y)=\hom_k(Y,X)$. 

Earlier, for $f\in \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ and $C$ defined by the equation $f=0$, we 
defined $C(A)=\{(a,b)\in A^2:f(a,b)=0\}$ for any $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $A$. 
Note that 
\begin{align*}
  C(A) &= \{(a,b)\in A^2:f(a,b) = 0\} \\
    &= \hom_{\mathsf{Alg}_\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f,A) \\
    &= \hom_{\mathsf{Sch}_k}\left(\spec A,\spec(\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/f)\right) \\
\end{align*}
so this agrees with our general definition. 

\begin{remark}
The functor $h_X$ determines $X$, up to isomorphism. (This is just the Yoneda 
lemma).
\end{remark}

For the rest of this section, let $C$ be a nice curve over $\mathbb{C}$. Set 
$X=C(\mathbb{C})$; this is a compact connected Riemann surface. So 
topologically, $X$ is a many-handled torus. Let $\Lambda=\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$, 
the first singular homology group of $X$, which can be identified with 
$\pi_1(X)^\text{ab}$. So elements of $\Lambda$ are equivalence classes 
$[\gamma]$ for $\gamma\in \pi_1(X)$. 

\begin{remark}
The notation $\h_\bullet$, $\pi_1$\ldots will always denote the 
\emph{topological} homology, fundamental group\ldots. For, e.g. 
etale cohomology, we will write $\h_\text{et}^\bullet(C,\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$, or 
$\h_\text{crys}^\bullet(X/\mathbb{Z}_p)$ for crystalline cohomology.
\end{remark}

It is a theorem of algebraic topology that $\Lambda\simeq\mathbb{Z}^{2 g}$; we 
will call $g$ the \emph{genus} of $X$ (and also of $C$). Let $K$ be the field 
of meromorphic functions on $X$. In other words, elements of $K$ are of the 
form $f=g/h$ where $g$ and $h$ are holomorphic functions on $X$ and $g\ne 0$. 
(This forces $g\ne 0$ except on a finite subset of $X$.) At any point 
$x\in X$, we can write $f$ in local coordinates as $z^n(a_0+a_1 z+\cdots)$ 
where $a_0\ne 0$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. We call $n=\ord_x(f)$ the \emph{order 
of vanishing} of $f$ at $x$. 
 
\begin{remark}
We can identify $K$ with the function field of $C$, i.e. the set of rational 
maps $C\to\mathbb{A}^1$. Certainly rational maps yield meromorphic functions, 
and it is a basic theorem of Riemann surface theory that meromorphic functions 
are in fact algebraic. Moreover, if $C$ is nice, then $C$ can be recovered 
from $K$. To do this, pick some $x\in K\setminus \mathbb{C}$. If we let $A$ be 
the integral closure of $\mathbb{C}[x]$ in $K$, then $\spec(A)$ will be a 
smooth affine curve. Pick some embedding of $\spec(A)$ into projective space; 
the closure of its image will be a projective curve $C'$ (possibly with 
singularities) with function field $K$. We can resolve the singularities of 
$C'$ to obtain a smooth projective curve $C''$ with function field $K$. 
Clearly $C''$ and $C$ are birational -- in fact this forces them to be 
isomorphic. Indeed, let $f:C''\to C$ be a birational map. By 
\cite[thm 3.1]{mi}, $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are in fact regular, hence $f$ is an 
isomorphism of varieties. 
\end{remark}

One might ask whether the singular homology $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$ can be 
defined ``algebraically.'' Essentially, the answer is no -- that is, there is 
no known algebraic definition for $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$ that gives the 
``right'' answers. On the other hand, $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Q})$ is naturally 
isomorphic to the dual of the algebraic de Rham cohomology 
$\h_\text{dR}^1(X/\mathbb{Q})$, and $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$ is naturally 
isomorphic to the dual of the $\ell$-adic cohomology 
$\h_\text{et}^1(X,\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$. Both of these isomorphisms are hard 
theorems -- the first follows from work of Grothendieck \cite{gr66}, the 
second from \cite[I 4.6.3]{de77}. 

With $C$ as before, let $V=\Omega^1(X)=\h^0(X,\Omega^1)=\h^1_\text{dR}(X)$. 
This is a complex vector space of dimension $g$. (Here, we mean analytic de 
Rham cohomology -- the algebraic de Rham cohomology would be denoted 
$\h_\text{dR}^1(C/\mathbb{C})$.) This gives us an algebraic definition of $g$. 
We can consider $\Omega^1$ as the sheaf of (algebraic) differentials, and 
$g=\dim_\mathbb{C}\h^0(X,\Omega^1)$. There is a pairing 
$\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})\otimes\h_\text{dR}^1(X)\to\mathbb{C}$, defined by 
\[
  [\gamma]\otimes \omega \mapsto \int_\gamma \omega
\]
This pairing is $\mathbb{C}$-linear in the second component, and is in fact 
non-degenerate. It gives us a map $\Phi:\Lambda\to V^*$. 

\begin{definition}[analytic]
The \emph{Jacobian} of $X$ is 
$\jac X=V^*/\Phi(X) = \h_\textnormal{dR}^1(X)^*/\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. 
\end{definition}

Is is known that $\Phi(\Lambda)$ is a lattice in $V^*$, i.e. it is discrete 
and $V^*/\Phi(\Lambda)$ is compact. There is the \emph{Abel-Jacobi map} from 
$X$ to $\jac X$ defined as follows. Fix $x_0\in X$; we send $x\in X$ to 
$\omega\mapsto \int_{[x_0,x]} \omega$, where $[x_0,x]$ denotes some path from 
$x_0$ to $x$. A different choice of $[x_0,x]$ will differ by a closed loop, 
i.e. an element of $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. So $X\to\jac X$ is well-defined. Note 
that $\jac X$ is a complex Lie group. 

\begin{remark}
After choosing a basis for $V^*$, we have $\jac X\simeq \mathbb{C}^g/L$, where 
$L\simeq \mathbb{Z}^{2 g}$. As a real Lie group, $\jac X$ is diffeomorphic to 
$(S^1)^{2 g}$. 
\end{remark}

We care about $\jac X$ because, despite its analytic definition, it is in fact 
a projective variety.

\begin{theorem}
For $X$ a compact Riemann surface, $\jac X$ is algebraic, i.e. there exists a 
variety $J$ defined over $\mathbb{C}$ such that $J(\mathbb{C})\simeq\jac X$ as 
complex manifolds. Moreover, the group operation on $\jac X$ is algebraic, 
i.e. there is a morphism $m:J\times_\mathbb{C} J\to J$ such that 
$J(\mathbb{C})\times J(\mathbb{C})\to J(\mathbb{C})$ corresponds to the 
addition law on $\jac X$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
look up in \cite{mu08}
\end{proof}

Let $\Div X$ be the free abelian group generated by the points of $X$. There 
is a map $\deg:\Div X\to \mathbb{Z}$, defined by 
$\sum n_x\cdot x\mapsto \sum n_x$. We define $\Div^\circ X$ by the short exact 
sequence 
\[
  0 \to \Div^\circ X \to \Div X \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
\]
There is also a map $\operatorname{div}:K^\times\to \Div X$, where 
$\operatorname{div}(f) = \sum_x \ord_x(f)\cdot x$. It is a basic fact that 
$\deg(\operatorname{div}(f)) = 0$, so we can define the \emph{Picard group} 
of $X$ to be $\pic X = \Div X/\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$ and 
$\pic^\circ X = \Div^\circ (X)/\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$. 

\begin{remark}
Let $\mathscr{M}$ be the sheaf of meromorphic functions on $X$. One can 
prove that $\Div(X)=\h^0(X,\mathscr{M}^\times/\mathscr{O}^\times)$ and 
$\pic(X)=\h^1(X,\mathscr{O}^\times)$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
One can prove that $\pic^\circ(\mathbb{P}^1) = 0$.
\end{example}

The Abel-Jacobi map $\mu:X\to \jac X$ extends to a map 
$\mu:\Div^\circ X\to \jac X$. 

\begin{theorem}[Jacobi]
The map $\mu:\Div^\circ X\to\jac X$ is surjective.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Abel]
The kernel of $\mu:\Div^\circ X\to \jac X$ is $\operatorname{div}(K^\times)$. 
\end{theorem}

It follows that $\mu$ induces an isomorphism $\mu:\pic^\circ X\to \jac X$. 
Note that $\pic^\circ X$ parameterizes invertible sheaves (line bundles) on 
$X$ of degree zero. 

Note that in general, $\mathbb{C}^g/L$ for some lattice $L$ need not be 
algebraic if $g>1$. In the future, we'll try to define $\jac C$ for a curve 
$C$ over an any field. The variety $\jac C$ will be a nice variety, i.e. 
smooth, projective and geometrically integral. We will use this to give an 
algebraic definition of $\h_1(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$.

\section{Jacobians in algebraic geometry}

Recall that a variety $X/k$ is \emph{nice} if it is smooth, projective, and 
geometrically connected. 

\begin{definition}
Let $k$ be a field. An \emph{abelian variety} over $k$ is a nice group variety 
over $k$.
\end{definition}

In other words, there are morphisms $m:A\times A\to A$, $i:A\to A$, 
$e:\spec(k)\to A$ such that the induced maps $m_*:h_A\times h_A\to h_A$ etc. 
turn $h_A$ into a group-valued functor. In particular, $A(X)$ is a ``actual 
group'' for each $k$-scheme $X$. 

\begin{example}
The group variety $\operatorname{GL}_n$ is a group variety, but not nice (in 
the technical sense) because it is not projective.
\end{example}

Note that abelian varieties are not required to be commutative, but this is in 
fact the case. This is easy to see over $\mathbb{C}$. If $A/\mathbb{C}$ is an 
abelian variety, then $G=A(\mathbb{C})$ is a compact connected complex Lie 
group. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra. Consider the composite map 
$f:G\xrightarrow{\text{ad}}\operatorname{GL}(\mathfrak{g}) \hookrightarrow 
\operatorname{End}(\mathfrak{g})$, where 
$\operatorname{ad}:G\to\operatorname{GL}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the adjoint 
representation. After picking a basis for $\operatorname{End}(\mathfrak{g})$, 
the components of $f$ are entire holomorphic functions on a compact complex 
manifold, hence locally constant. Since $G$ is connected, $f$ is constant, i.e. 
$\operatorname{ad}$ is the trivial representation. But 
$\ker(\operatorname{ad}) = Z(G)$, so $G$ is commutative. For more details, see 
\cite[I.1]{mu08}. The case $A/k$ for arbitrary $k$ of characteristic zero 
follows from the Lefschetz principle, or one can just prove commutativity 
directly using a ``rigidity principle'' for maps on projective varieties
\cite[I.1.4]{mi}. 

We'd like to describe the jacobian $J$ of a nice curve $C/k$ with 
$C(k)\ne\varnothing$. It will be an abelian variety over $k$ of dimension 
$g$, the genus of $C$. (Note we've only defined the genus for curves 
$C/k$ with $k\subset\mathbb{C}$. For general curves, we set  
$g(C)=h^0(C_{\bar k},\Omega^1) = h^1(\mathscr{O}_C)$, where 
$h^i(X,\mathscr{F})$ for some sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ denotes 
$\dim_k\h^i(X,\mathscr{F})$. 

\begin{definition}[Albanese]
Let $C/k$ be a curve with fixed $x_0\in C(k)$. The \emph{jacobian} of $C$ is 
an abelian variety $J$ with a morphism $\mu:C\to J$ taking $x_0$ to $0$, such 
that for any morphism $f:C\to A$ to an abelian variety $A$ with $f(x_0)=0$, 
thre is a unique $\tilde f:J\to A$ making the following diagram commute:
\[\xymatrix{
  C \ar[r]^-\mu \ar[dr]_-f 
    & J \ar@{.>}[d]^-{\tilde f} \\
  & A
}\]
\end{definition}

Standard abstract nonsense shows that the pair $(J,\mu)$ is unique up to 
unique isomorphism. There is a more concise way of defining $J=J_C$. The 
assignment $C\mapsto J_C$ is the left-adjoint to the functor 
$\mathsf{AbVar}_k\to \mathsf{Var}_{k,*}$ from abelian varieties over $k$ to 
nice pointed varieties over $k$ that forgets the group structure. In fact, the 
functor $\mathsf{AbVar}_k\to\mathsf{Var}_{k,*}$ has a left-adjoint defined 
on all of $\mathsf{Var}_{k,*}$. For any nice pointed variety $X$, there is an 
abelian variety $A=\operatorname{Alb} X$, the \emph{Albanese variety} of $X$, 
such that pointed maps $X\to B$ correspond to homomorphisms of abelian 
varieties $A\to B$. For a proof that $\operatorname{Alb} X$ exists, see 
\cite[A.11]{mo12}

If $C(k)=\varnothing$, we can still define $J=\jac C$. We consider the 
morphism $\alpha:C\times C\to J$ given by $(x,y)\mapsto \mu(x)-\mu(y)$, 
and require maps $f:C\times C\to A$ with $f(\Delta)=0$ to lift uniquely 
to $\tilde f:J\to A$. 

Another approach to defining $J=\jac C$ involves the Picard group. Recall 
that over $\mathbb{C}$, we proved that $J(\mathbb{C}\simeq\pic^\circ(C)$. 
One might hope that $J$ satisfies $J(L)=\pic^\circ(C_L)$ for all field 
extensions $L/k$. This works if $C(k)\ne\varnothing$, but otherwise. For, 
if $J(k^s)=\pic^\circ(C_{k^s})$, then we would have 
$\pic^\circ(C) = J(k) = J(k^s)^{G_k} = \pic^\circ(C_{k^s})^{G_k}$. But this 
does not always hold. 

First, it might be helpful to define Picard groups for general schemes. If 
$X$ is a scheme, the \emph{Picard group} of $X$ is 
$\pic(X)=\h^1(X,\mathscr{O}_X^\times)$. It is straightforward to show that 
$\pic(X)$ is isomorphic to the group of isomorphism classes of invertible 
sheaves on $X$, with group operation induced by tensor product, i.e. 
$[\mathscr{L}] + [\mathscr{L'}] = [\mathscr{L}\otimes \mathscr{L}']$. 

If $D = \sum n_x\cdot x$ is a divisor on a curve $C/k$, we define the 
\emph{degree} of $D$ to be $\deg D=\sum n_x \in \mathbb{Z}$. There is a more 
intrinsic definition of $\deg D$, which runs as follows. First, we can replace 
$D$ by $\mathscr{L}=\mathscr{O}(D)$, the invertible sheaf induced by $D$. For 
a general sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on $C$, let 
$\chi(C)=\sum (-1)^i h^i(\mathscr{F})$. Then for $n\gg 0$, the Riemann-Roch 
theorem implies that $\chi(\mathscr{L}^n)$ is linear $n$. The coefficient of 
$n$ is called the \emph{degree} of $\mathscr{L}$. Now, for $T$ an arbitrary 
scheme, define $\pic^\circ(C\times T)$ to be the subset of $\pic(C\times T)$ 
consisting of invertible sheaves $\mathscr{L}$ with $\deg\mathscr{L}_t=0$ for 
all $t\in T$, i.e. the following sequence is exact
\[\xymatrix{
  0 \ar[r] 
    & \pic^\circ(C\times T) \ar[r]^-{(i_t^*)}
    & \displaystyle\prod_{t\in T} \pic^\circ (C) 
}\]
where $i_t:t\hookrightarrow T$ are the canonical injections. Now we define the 
functor $P_C^\circ:\mathsf{Sch}_k^\circ\to\mathsf{Ab}$ that sends $T$ to 
$\pic^\circ(C\times_k T)/\pi_T^*\pic(T)$. 

\begin{theorem}
If $C(k)\ne \varnothing$, then $P_C^\circ$ is represented by $J=\jac C$.
\end{theorem}

For a proof, see \cite[III.1.2]{mi}. 

\begin{remark}
In general, the map $X\to \operatorname{Alb} X$ need not be an embedding. 
For example, if $C$ is a curve of genus $0$, then $\operatorname{Alb} X=0$ by 
\cite[I.3.9]{mi}. On the other hand, if the genus $g\geqslant 1$, then 
$C\to J$ is an embedding. The map $C(\bar k)\to \pic^\circ(C_{\bar k})$ sends 
a point $x$ to the divisor $[x]-[x_0]$, and one can check that this is 
injective. For, principal divisors correspond to morphisms 
$f:C\to\mathbb{P}^1$. These cannot have zeros and poles of multiplicity one, 
otherwise $f$ would have degree one, hence it would be an isomorphism. This 
cannot be the case. 
\end{remark}

In general, we might have $C(k)=\varnothing$. We will have 
$J(L)=\pic^\circ(C_{L'})^{\gal(L'/L)}$ where $L'/L$ is any separable extension 
with $C(L')\ne\varnothing$. 

The idea behind Weil's original construction is the following. We already 
know that $J=\jac C$ exists, and has a canonical map $\mu:C\to J$. Consider 
$C^g=C\times\cdots\times C$ ($g$-fold product), and consider the map 
$f:C^g\to J$, $f(x_1,\dotsc,x_g)=\mu(x_1)+\cdots+\mu(x_g)$. The symmetric 
group $S_g$ acts on $C^g$, and $f$ is $S_g$-equivariant. The quotient 
$\operatorname{Sym}^g C = C^g/S_g$ exists, and has a map 
$\operatorname{Sym}^g C\to J$. This is birational. Weil defined a ``rational 
group law'' on $\operatorname{Sym}^g C$ using the Riemann-Roch theorem. For 
more details on Weil's construction (and proofs), see \cite[III.7]{mi}.
